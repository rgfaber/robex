## Introduction

Maybe you remember your very first programming lesson. For me, it was an excercise called 'Robby the Robot' and the reqyuirement was to make a robot nove along a grid, from point A to B, using the commands WEST, EAST, SOUTH, NORTH.
Being a total newbie at erlang and elixir, I will first try to implement this in erlang, and see where it brings us.


## Motivation

- As **a software engineer**
- I want to **implement 'Robby the Robot' in erlang and later elixir**
- So **I can learn this ecosystem**
- And **become an expert**
